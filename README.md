# Developh Chapters
Connecting creation to your community.

The Developh Chapters program links high school coding, tech, and entrepreneurship clubs together under a global network. High school is one of the most crucial times for students to begin thinking about their careers and what they want to do, and strong computing clubs that provide students a type of education they can't get in the classroom and a continuing community can lead them to think bigger, nurturing pathways for them to become founders, developers, designers, and doers.

We're piloting the program in the Philippines this 2019 for interested institutions and our outreach partners. We're championing students to build things that matter to them and the world around them, connection creation to their advocacy and making an impact. 


## The Mechanics
* Clubs/organizations can retain their name or be formed as a new chapter of Developh. (Our goal isn't to advance Developh's branding, but to link groups together and solidify a global tech network.)
* Application for chapters 
** Onboarding call: Get at least one other peer who is interested in starting a club with you, and try to get your hands on an adult/faculty supervisor
* Documents to fill out
** Three-month plan: what activities, events, and programs do you want to target within three months? This helps us get a solid idea of your commitment to the club, and helps us strategize on how we can support your club and coordinate with other clubs nationwide.
** For new clubs: Registration with school if based in educational institution (optional, we've operated chapters without being recognized by the school but check how strict your institution is and if there will be any limitations imposed)
